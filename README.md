# Transportation Problem
This project contains 3 python modules:
- `balacing.py`: balance the problem to work with simplex method
- `initial_feasible_solution.py`: find the initial point by northwest corner rule
- `simplex_method.py`: contain the simplex method

# Example
```python
supply = [50,70,80]
demand = [60,30,40,70]
costs = [[2,4,5,1],
         [3,6,4,8],
         [1,2,5,3]]
```
